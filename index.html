                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Sam Zakharia, part business-owner part software developer. I discovered my passion for software development in recent years and decided to pursue it by 
                    enrolling into an MS-CS program at University of Colorado Boulder. My journey began in Beirut, Lebanon where I obtained my Bachelors of Science in Chemistry at the American University of Beirut, one of the most prestigious universities in the Middle East. 
                    Upon gruadation, I moved to the United States to begin the next phase of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked in the quality control department of a couple neutraceutical manfucaturors for a few years before deciding to take a leap of faith and start my own business in 2016. I established a highly rated restaurant, called <a href="https://www.barbonzai.com/" target="_blank">Barbonzai</a>, and expanded to a second location in 2022. 
                During this time, after a few years of running the business, I began dabbling in software development and discovered my true passion. In an effort to formalize my education, I enrolled into an MS-CS program at University of Colorado Boulder. </p>
                <p> Since then, I have had various personal projects and the most notable of these is GM-AI, an AI based world builder for fantasy worlds and Dungeons & Dragons players. </p>
                <p> I am currently looking for a full-time software development position in the San Diego or Orange County Area. </p>
